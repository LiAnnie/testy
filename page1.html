				<h4>Writing</h4>
				I enjoy writing stories because it helps me express myself. Spoooky stories are fun for me to read
				and write because there is an exciting shivery feeling.

			<li class="grey">
				<h4>Gaming</h4>
				I play video games for social interactions. My cousin, Angela, first introduced me to Wizard101 when
				I visited her in the United States. We used to play together whenever I visited. We formed a group 
				with the people that we met on the game, and although we don't play Wizard101 anymore, we've been 
				playing together ever since. I mainly spend my free 
				<br><!--For better looking format-->
				time on Genshin Impact these days. 
			</li>
			<li class="grey">
				<h4>Watching Videos</h4>
				I usually have a video running in the background while I work because it helps me to stay awake. 
				I don't often know what's going on in the videos, but I still enjoy listening to the 
				<br>
				sound of people talking. Sometimes, I watch television series like NCIS, but most of the time 
				<br>
				I just watch Youtube.

				<h4>Drawing</h4>
				Ever since I was six, I've been going to art classes. It made me enjoy drawing and other 
				<br>
				forms of art. Sometimes when I'm in online class, I have a sketchbook open in front of me. I enjoy
				sketching realistic art the most, because the end result is super satisfying to look at.
			</li>
			<li class="grey">
				<h4>Gambling</h4>
				I enjoy playing cards with my family for money. Each round won is one dollar, and each 
				<br>
				round lost loses one dollar. The most anyone has ever won is five dollars, but it's still fun to 
				play with something on the line.
